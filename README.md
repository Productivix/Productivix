- 👋 Hi,
- 👀 I’m developping mobile Android offline apps for scanning & mesuring (so barcodes), traceability, mainly for productions, logistics , transports, medicals.

- 💞️ I help in projects on geoloc, OCR, scan, shape reconnition, OTA updates for Android (or some Ios) mobile apps in React Native, programs without Google Play, with Node serveurs.
